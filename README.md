# Training IRIS

This repository contains the process of exploring the infamous Iris dataset, training and choosing the best algorithm with maximum accuracy for the dataset.
Exploring and training models have been done using both R(caret) and Python(scikit-learn).


In these notebooks, I have tried training a model with five different Machine Learning algorithms.
1. Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)
2. Classification and Regression Trees(CART)
3. k-Nearest Neighbors(kNN)
4. Support Vector Machines(SVM) with a linear kernel
5. Random Forest(RF)

## R
- using RStudio is recommended for opening R markdown file. (Iris.Rmd)
- Open the R notebook in an internet browser to see its contents. (Iris.nb.html)
